## khypervprovider install

Installs this application as a Windows service

### Synopsis


You can serve via HTTPS by either
* Generating self signed certs with --ssl and related flags
* Providing a pre-created cert with --cert and --key

If you generate them here, all the cert files will be stored in the same
directory as this EXE.

Use --directory to specify where the service will store VHD volumes it creates.
If you omit this flag, the service will locate the locally attached drive with
the most free storage and create directory "Kubernetes Persistent Volumes" at
its root.



```
khypervprovider install [flags]
